DBMS- database Management system
definition
helps in handling large data base
for ex. all details of students of college
data are stored in two ways--Json format and table format

to create data base there is a querry

create database name;   #name can be anything
use name;               #to enter the database u have created 

#now we have to create a table in the database to work upon
create table student(             #we are using student as the name of the table
studentid varchar(100),
age int,
city varchar(100));        #varchar= it is used to specify the size of the input


insert into student values(("rohan",19,"delhi"),("Parth",18,"haryana"));   #this command is used to enter the data in the table

select * from personal_info where age > 30;   # this command is used to get specific data according to our need        
                                             #"where"

update personal_info set name='iron man' where age = 30;   #"update" is used to change the pre existing data from the table as shown
                                                           #through the use of "set" we enter the new info and use"where" to tell where the change should be done
